## Overview

Small on-device language models generally can't sustain a persona across years of conversation the way a much larger model with a huge context window can — they either forget, hallucinate memories, or answer confidently when they shouldn't. This project asks how much of that gap can be closed without scaling parameters: by pairing a ~2B-parameter vision-capable model with an external memory/retrieval system, LoRA post-training (SFT → DPO → on-policy distillation), and quantization for on-device inference, then measuring the result against an adversarial benchmark built specifically to catch abstention failures and false memories, not just recall accuracy.

Every result below links to a doc with full methodology and honest limitations, including negative/inconclusive findings reported as such. Full research-question hierarchy and hypotheses: [`docs/research_questions.md`](docs/research_questions.md).

## Results

| Model | Dataset | Method | pra_lenient | UAR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | — | raw model, no memory | 0.16% | 13.75% |
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | SFT v0 (202 ex) | LoRA SFT, no memory | 0.16% | 16.25% |
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | — | + hybrid retrieval memory (k=8), no SFT | 15.10% | 8.75% |
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | SFT v0 + memory | LoRA SFT + memory | 17.76% | 33.75% |
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | SFT v1 (2232 ex) + DPO v1 (2049 pairs) | proper-scale LoRA SFT → DPO + memory | — | 70.0% |
| `gemma-4-E2B-it` | + distill v1 (2008 prompts) | + on-policy distillation from `gemma-4-E4B-it` | 18.59% | 71.25% |

`pra_lenient` and UAR are measured against **PMB** (Personalized Memory Benchmark), 688 adversarial probes across 8 categories (factual, episodic, temporal, preference, continuity, outdated-fact, distractor, unanswerable).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion.git
cd small-mind-companion
uv sync             # base install (CPU-only, lint/test)
```

Smallest runnable example — generate a response using retrieved memory:

```python
from onebee.inference.engine import HFEngine, GenerationConfig

engine = HFEngine("arrochi112/onebee-gf-distill-v1")
response = engine.generate([
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a warm AI companion who remembers this user."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What conference did I say I was attending?"},
], GenerationConfig(max_new_tokens=128))
print(response)
```

For the full memory-retrieval-augmented pipeline (not just a raw checkpoint), see `run_system_e_distill.py` at the repo root.

## Dataset

Two data families, both versioned and hash-pinned in `data/`:

- **PMB (evaluation)**: `data/benchmarks/pmb_v0_full/` — 688 adversarial probes across 40 personas, each probe categorized (factual/episodic/temporal/preference/continuity/outdated-fact/distractor/unanswerable) with a gold answer, supporting-memory IDs, and acceptable alternatives.
- **SFT / DPO / distillation (training)**: `data/sft/v1/`, `data/dpo/v1_scale/`, `data/distill/v1/` — each with a `DATASHEET.md` describing generation methodology, class balance, and known caveats (e.g. not human-reviewed, not yet contamination-checked against PMB at generation time — verify with `scripts/check_contamination.py` before reusing).

Splits: SFT v1 is 2232 train / 248 val; DPO v1_scale is 2049 train / 228 val; distillation v1 is 2008 train / 224 val prompts (prompt-only — the student generates its own completions on-policy).

Personas used for training data are generated disjoint from the PMB eval personas (separate seed, separate output directory) — see each `DATASHEET.md` for the exact construction method.

## Training

All runs so far were single-GPU LoRA fine-tunes on a rented workstation (see [Hardware](#hardware)) — no multi-GPU or distributed training has been needed at this model/data scale.

### Single GPU

```bash
uv sync --extra gpu --extra dev

# SFT
uv run python -m onebee.training.sft --config configs/training/sft_v1.yaml

# DPO (chains off the SFT output)
uv run python -m onebee.training.dpo --config configs/training/dpo_v1_scale.yaml

# On-policy distillation (chains off the DPO output)
uv run python -m onebee.training.distill --config configs/training/distill_v1.yaml
```

### Multi-GPU / Distributed Training

Not implemented — out of scope at the current ~2B-parameter, LoRA-rank-16 training scale. Revisit if a full-parameter or larger-model training pass is added later.

## Configuration

Every run is a composed YAML config under `configs/training/` — no hardcoded hyperparameters in code. The values that matter most:

| Field | SFT v1 | DPO v1_scale | Distill v1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lora_r` / `lora_alpha` | 16 / 32 | 16 / 32 | 16 / 32 |
| `learning_rate` | 1e-4 | (DPO default) | 1e-6 (conservative — refining an already-trained checkpoint) |
| `num_train_epochs` | 2.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 (125 steps) |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | 8 | — | 2 (on-policy generation is more expensive per step) |
| `max_seq_length` / `max_completion_length` | 2048 | — | 128 |
| `teacher_model` | — | — | `google/gemma-4-E4B-it` (8B, same tokenizer/vocab as the student) |
| `seed` | 1337 | — | — |

Full configs: [`configs/training/sft_v1.yaml`](configs/training/sft_v1.yaml), [`configs/training/dpo_v1_scale.yaml`](configs/training/dpo_v1_scale.yaml), [`configs/training/distill_v1.yaml`](configs/training/distill_v1.yaml).

## Evaluation

```bash
uv sync --extra judge --extra dev
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...  # LLM judge for PRA/UAR scoring and pairwise comparisons

uv run python run_system_e_distill.py          # generate + score the current-best system against PMB
uv run python compare_c_vs_f_distill.py        # pairwise persona-consistency, pre- vs post-distillation
```

Metrics are computed with an LLM judge under dual-order (position-bias-controlled) scoring plus a rule-based abstention detector — see [`src/onebee/evaluation/`](src/onebee/evaluation/) for the scoring implementation and [`docs/proper_scale_results.md`](docs/proper_scale_results.md) for the full methodology.

## Checkpoints

Trained checkpoints are published to Hugging Face Hub, not committed to git (`outputs/` is gitignored). Resume/load any stage from its HF repo:

```bash
hf download arrochi112/onebee-gf-distill-v1 --local-dir outputs/distill/v1/merged
```

| Checkpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| [`onebee-gf-sft-v0`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-sft-v0) | Day 4 v0 SFT (202 train examples) |
| [`onebee-gf-sft-v1`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-sft-v1) | Proper-scale SFT, rebalanced (2232 train examples) |
| [`onebee-gf-dpo-v0`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v0) | Week 2 DPO v0 (1 epoch, 200 pairs) |
| [`onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch) | DPO v0 data, 4 epochs (overfitting experiment) |
| [`onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale) | Proper-scale DPO, pre-distillation |
| [`onebee-gf-distill-v1`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-distill-v1) | SFT+DPO+distillation (H23) — **current best overall** |
| [`onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale-gguf`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale-gguf) | GGUF quantizations (of the pre-distillation checkpoint) |

Repo names still carry the project's earlier `onebee-gf` name (predates a repo rename to `small-mind-companion`) — renaming them would mean recreating and re-uploading tens of GB per repo, not worth it for a naming-only change.

## Experiments

| # | Hypothesis | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1, H4, H5 | Memory retrieval and SFT each help; combined beats either alone | Confirmed at v0 scale | [`docs/day3_memory_results.md`](docs/day3_memory_results.md) |

| — | GGUF quantization preserves generation quality | Confirmed down to Q4_K_M by manual + automated checks | [`docs/quantization_results.md`](docs/quantization_results.md) |
| H22 | Abliteration increases compliance at the cost of judgment quality | Eval harness built, not yet run | [`docs/research_questions.md`](docs/research_questions.md) |
| — | ORPO as an alternative to DPO | Blocked — not supported by the pinned `trl` version | [`docs/model_quirks.md`](docs/model_quirks.md) #15 |

## Hardware

All training and quantization runs were done on a single rented workstation GPU (NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell class, ~96GB VRAM) — sufficient headroom for LoRA fine-tuning and on-policy distillation of a ~2B/8B student/teacher pair without offloading. Quantization benchmarks (generation speed table below) were run CPU-only, since the deployment target is on-device/mobile inference, not GPU-served inference.

| Quant | Size | Generation speed (CPU, 30 threads) |
|---|---|---|
| F16 | 8.64 GiB | 26.15 t/s |
| Q8_0 | 4.61 GiB | 43.07 t/s |
| **Q4_K_M** | **3.18 GiB** | **58.00 t/s** (recommended default) |

Full quantization spread (F16 through Q2_K, 12 levels) and methodology: [`docs/quantization_results.md`](docs/quantization_results.md).

## Results & Analysis

- **Root-caused a calibration regression to two independent bugs, then fixed both and re-verified end-to-end.** Scaling the training data 10x initially appeared to make the model *worse* at abstaining on unanswerable questions. Investigation found: (1) a naive text-based dedup step in the data-generation script was silently collapsing ~227 intended abstention training examples down to 1; (2) after fixing that, the eval harness's own abstention detector didn't recognize the model's newly-correct phrasing, making a genuine improvement look like a further regression. Fixing both exposed a real third issue — over-correction into excessive hedging — resolved by rebalancing training-data ratios. Full trail: [`docs/proper_scale_results.md`](docs/proper_scale_results.md), [`docs/model_quirks.md`](docs/model_quirks.md) #16-17.
- **Found and fixed a rubric-construction bug that inflated a zero-context baseline to ~94% accuracy** — an operator-precedence bug in a string-concatenation expression silently dropped the gold answer from the judge's rubric whenever a probe had no listed alternatives. Caught because a model with no memory access scoring 94% on personalized-recall is *definitionally* impossible. [`docs/model_quirks.md`](docs/model_quirks.md).
- **Distillation's training-time metrics looked unhealthy (flat loss, unstable grad norm, ~95-98% completion clipping) but real evaluation showed a clean positive result** — a case where trusting the eval harness over the training curve mattered. [`docs/distillation_results.md`](docs/distillation_results.md).
- **21 real environment/API/tooling bugs found, fixed, and documented** across the stack, each with a root cause and fix, not just "it broke": [`docs/model_quirks.md`](docs/model_quirks.md).

## Reproducibility

- All training seeds are pinned in their respective config files (e.g. `seed: 1337` in `configs/training/sft_v1.yaml`).
- Base model revision is pinned by commit SHA, not a moving tag (`base_model_revision` in each config).
- Every dataset directory has a `hash.txt` and `DATASHEET.md` documenting exact generation methodology and known caveats.
- `uv.lock` pins every dependency version.
- Hypotheses and eval design are committed to git *before* results — git history itself is the pre-registration record.
