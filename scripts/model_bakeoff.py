"""Day-1 base-model selection bake-off.

Runs a 40-prompt smoke set (10 instruction-following, 10 EN dialogue, 10 JA
dialogue, 10 structured-context-adherence) against each ~1B candidate model,
scores every response with an OpenAI-backed judge, and writes the comparison
into ``docs/adr/0001-model-selection.md``.

The project's stress test is a persistent AI-girlfriend companion expected to
sustain a coherent persona across years of conversation, not a one-shot
assistant — so the EN/JA dialogue prompts probe emotional attunement rather
than generic small talk, and the structured-context prompts are shaped as
injected relationship-memory blocks (the actual production context shape)
rather than encyclopedia trivia. Instruction-following stays general-purpose
since it measures a distinct capability axis (format/constraint adherence).

Heavy deps (torch/transformers/huggingface_hub for the model runs, openai for
the judge) are imported lazily so ``--help`` works in any environment.
