# Proper-scale training results (tasks #40-47, the "train properly" pass)

**Status:** real results, single seed, 10x the data scale of the v0/Day-4/Week-2 proof-of-concept
runs (`docs/day4_sft_results.md`, `docs/dpo_results.md`). Raw data in `results/v1_scale/`.

## What changed vs the v0 pass

Scaled from 4 to 40 personas, generating a 2242-example SFT dataset (`data/sft/v1/`, up from
225) and a 2277-pair DPO preference dataset (`data/dpo/v1_scale/`, up from 223), both
contamination-checked clean against the fixed `pmb_v0_full` eval set (unchanged throughout).
Trained SFT with the doc-recommended batch size (8, grad-accum 4, vs v0's 4/2) for 2 epochs,
then DPO on top for 1 epoch (257 steps, vs v0's 25). Full training details:
`docs/day4_sft_v1_results.md`, `docs/dpo_results.md`'s "Follow-up: proper scale" section.

## Headline numbers

Systems A (raw) and D (raw + memory) don't depend on trained checkpoints, so their v0.1 numbers
are unchanged and reused directly.

| System | Description | pra_lenient | uar |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | raw, no memory | 0.16% | 13.75% |
| B (v0) | SFT v0 (225 ex), no memory | 0.16% | 16.25% |
| **B (v1)** | **SFT v1 (2242 ex), no memory** | **0.16%** | **31.25%** |
| D | raw + memory (k=8) | 15.10% | 8.75% |
| E (v0) | SFT v0 + memory | 17.76% | 33.75% |
| **E (v1)** | **SFT v1 + memory** | **18.42%** | **16.25%** |

Pairwise C(SFT+DPO) vs E(SFT only), dual-order judge, 105 answerable probes (same sampling
seed/stratification as v0 for direct comparability):

| | v0 (1 epoch, 223 pairs) | v1_scale (1 epoch, 2277 pairs) |
|---|---|---|
| C wins | 26/105 (24.8%) | **41/105 (39.0%)** |
| E wins | 23/105 (21.9%) | 21/105 (20.0%) |
| Ties | 56/105 (53.3%) | 43/105 (41.0%) |
| **Gap** | **2.9pp** | **19.0pp** |

## Two real, honest findings — one clearly positive, one a genuine regression

### 1. DPO's effect finally becomes clearly distinguishable at proper scale

The C-vs-E win-rate gap jumped from 2.9pp (v0, not distinguishable from noise at n=105) to
19.0pp (v1_scale) — a real, much larger margin, consistent with H6's prediction that DPO
improves persona consistency, and consistent with the earlier v0/v1(4-epoch) observation that
more training pushed the gap in the same direction (see `docs/dpo_results.md`). At proper data
scale (10x more, still-diverse preference pairs, not just more epochs on the same 200), the
effect is now large enough to plausibly call a real (not just directionally-suggestive) result,
though still only a single seed/run — not a fully confirmed H6 verdict, but the strongest
evidence for it collected so far in this project.

### 2. System E's calibration got WORSE at proper scale, even though System B's got much better

This is the unplanned, less comfortable finding, and it's reported honestly rather than
downplayed. SFT alone (B) shows a large calibration improvement with more data — UAR nearly
doubled (16.25%→31.25%). But SFT+memory together (E) shows the *opposite* pattern versus v0:
UAR dropped from 33.75% to 16.25%, even as `pra_lenient` ticked up slightly (17.76%→18.42%).

Manually inspected `results/v1_scale/E_sft_memory/raw.jsonl`'s unanswerable-category responses
to rule out a scoring/wiring bug before trusting this (per this project's own "suspiciously
good/bad is a bug signal" discipline, previously validated twice on other findings — see
`docs/model_quirks.md`). This is real: the v1 SFT+memory model actively **confabulates specific
false answers** to unanswerable questions rather than abstaining, e.g.:
- Q: "What was your childhood nickname?" → A: "Your childhood nickname was **Panda**."
  (fabricated — not present in any real memory)
- Q: "What was my last vacation destination?" → A: "Your last vacation was to **Cape Town**,
  which you remember as especially memorable..." (fabricated, stated with confident detail)

Only 13/80 unanswerable probes were correctly abstained for E(v1), vs a much higher rate for
E(v0). This happens *despite* the v1 SFT dataset containing the same ~10% abstention-example
design as v0 (see `data/sft/v1/DATASHEET.md`) and despite retrieved memory context being present
in all these cases (the model isn't ignoring memory — it's actively inventing plausible-sounding
specifics *from* the retrieved context about a *different* fact than what was asked).

**Working hypothesis (not confirmed):** with 10x more real conversational memory available per
persona (memory stores are correspondingly larger — `data/stores/sft_personas_v1/` averages
~62 rows/persona vs v0's smaller stores), the model may have learned a stronger prior toward
"there's probably an answer somewhere in all this context" that overrides the abstention
behavior learned from the ~10% abstention examples, which did not scale up their *proportion*
of unanswerable-with-large-context scenarios. This is a plausible but untested explanation, not
a confirmed mechanism — flagged as a real, useful limitation for a future pass (e.g. increasing
the abstention-example fraction, or making abstention examples specifically pair large
retrieved-context sets with unanswerable questions, rather than assuming the same 10% ratio
scales cleanly).

## Interpretation against pre-registered hypotheses

- **H5** (memory-aware SFT beats generic SFT when evaluated with memory): still holds directionally
  at v1 scale (`pra_lenient` D→E: 15.10%→18.42%, a smaller gap than v0's but still positive) —
  not overturned, but the calibration side of H5's story (the "unplanned but striking" UAR
  finding from Day 4) does **not** replicate at this scale; if anything it partially reverses.
  This is worth flagging clearly: the Day-4 v0 write-up's framing that "SFT dramatically
  improves calibration with memory" should not be read as a scale-invariant result.
- **H6** (DPO improves persona consistency more than SFT alone): the strongest evidence yet
  (19.0pp gap vs v0's 2.9pp), consistent with H6, but still a single seed/run at one data scale
  — genuinely encouraging, not yet a fully confirmed result.

## Investigation and fix: two real bugs, one genuine remaining tradeoff (2026-08-14)

The System E calibration regression above was investigated to root cause. Two independent, real bugs were found and fixed — full technical detail in
`docs/model_quirks.md` items #16-17. Short version:

**Bug #1 — dedup collapse.** `generate_sft_data.py` deduped training examples by exact
assistant-response text. `memory_relevant` examples have naturally-unique teacher-generated
text, so this was fine for them, but `abstention`/`irrelevant_retrieval` examples use a FIXED
template response by design — so after the first one, every subsequent example looked like an
exact duplicate and got silently dropped. Both `data/sft/v0/` and `data/sft/v1/` had only
**1** real abstention example survive, instead of the intended ~10% of the dataset (~227 for
v1). **Fixed:** only dedup `memory_relevant` by response text; dedup the templated categories
by the full `(system, user, response)` tuple instead. Regenerating gave 129 abstention + 341
irrelevant-retrieval examples (up from 1 each).

**Bug #2 — abstention detector gap.** After fixing #1 and retraining, UAR (measured by the
harness's rule-based `detect_abstention`) initially looked *worse*, not better (2.5% vs the
broken run's 16.25%). Manually reading the raw responses showed the model was now correctly
producing the exact intended abstention phrase (`"I don't think you've told me that — I don't
want to guess."`) — but `src/onebee/evaluation/graders/rule.py`'s `_ABSTENTION_PHRASES` list
didn't include that literal training-target string, so a correctly-abstaining model was being
scored as not abstaining. **Fixed:** added the actual template phrases to the detector, with a
regression test that asserts these exact strings are recognized.

### The corrected picture, after both fixes

Rescored all runs' already-saved raw responses with the fixed detector (no need to re-run
inference/judging):

| | UAR (unanswerable, correct) | False-abstention rate (answerable, incorrect) |
|---|---|---|
| v1 broken dedup (original) | 16.25% (13/80) | 9.9% (60/608) |
| **v1 fixed dedup** | **96.25% (77/80)** | **69.2% (421/608)** |
| B (SFT-v1 alone, fixed data) | 25.0% (20/80) | 39.8% (242/608) |

The dedup fix (Bug #1) worked exactly as intended — restoring the abstention training signal
took UAR from 16.25% to 96.25%, far exceeding v0's 33.75% and confirming the original root-
cause hypothesis. **But this is not simply "the fix worked, story closed."** The same fix that
taught the model to abstain correctly on genuinely unanswerable questions also taught it to
hedge on a huge fraction (69.2%) of *answerable* ones — a real, new problem, not a scoring
artifact (confirmed by directly reading raw responses and manually computing the rate from
saved data, same discipline used to validate the original finding). `pra_lenient` for E
dropped to 10.2% as a direct consequence (most of System E's C-vs-E comparison became ties —
79/105, up from 43/105 — because both systems now frequently produce the same generic hedge).

**Honest conclusion:** the calibration regression wasn't really "regression vs v0," it was two
independent measurement/data bugs compounding in a way that made the true picture invisible.
With both fixed, the real underlying issue is a genuine precision/recall tradeoff: the ~17% of
training data devoted to templated abstention/irrelevant-retrieval responses, restored to its
intended proportion, is now too aggressive relative to the `memory_relevant` majority — the
model over-generalizes "give the canned hedge" as a low-risk, low-loss default. This is not
mysterious or hard to explain (short, fixed-string targets are easy wins for the loss function
compared to generating a correct, specific, longer answer), and it's a real, addressable next
step, not an open mystery:

- Reduce the abstention/irrelevant-retrieval fraction (currently ~17% combined) — likely
  over-corrected once the dedup bug was fixed and its full intended weight applied.
- Diversify the abstention/irrelevant template responses (multiple paraphrasings instead of one
  fixed string each) so the model can't take the shortcut of memorizing one low-entropy phrase
  as a universal hedge.
- Weight the loss so answerable/memory_relevant examples aren't outnumbered in effective
  gradient signal by the now-much-larger templated categories.

These three fixes (lower ratios: irrelevant 15%→6%, abstain 10%→5%; 4 diversified paraphrases
per category instead of 1 fixed string; matching detector phrase additions) were then actually
implemented and re-verified end-to-end, to fix the tradeoff rather than leave it as a noted
limitation.

## Rebalancing fix, implemented and verified (2026-08-14)

Regenerated `data/sft/v1/` with the lower ratios and diversified templates
(`irrelevant_retrieval`: 136 examples at ~6%, `abstention`: 105 at ~5%, vs the over-corrected
run's 341/129 — and critically, almost no examples lost to the dedup filter this time: 2480
survived out of 2526 generated, vs the earlier fix's heavier post-generation loss, because
varied phrasing means fewer near-duplicate full-example collisions). Retrained SFT (token
accuracy 81.6%, in line with prior runs) and DPO on top (reward accuracy 100%, margin 11.98,
consistent with prior DPO runs), then re-ran the full B/E/C evaluation.

### The full three-point trajectory (all rescored with the fixed detector)

| | UAR (unanswerable, correct) | False-abstention (answerable, incorrect) | `pra_lenient` (E) |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 broken dedup (bug #1 only) | 16.25% | 9.9% | 18.42% |
| v1 dedup fixed, ratios/templates untouched (over-corrected) | 96.25% | 69.2% | 10.2% |
| **v1 rebalanced (final)** | **70.0%** | **32.1%** | **15.3%** |

This is a real, substantial improvement over the over-corrected version, and a much better
overall operating point than either extreme:
- UAR more than doubled v0's own 33.75% baseline (70.0% vs 33.75%) and is far above the
  originally-broken run's 16.25% — the core finding (fixing the dedup bug genuinely helps
  calibration) holds up.
- False-abstention on answerable questions dropped by more than half from the over-corrected
  run (69.2%→32.1%) — the model is meaningfully less trigger-happy about hedging on things it
  actually knows.
- `pra_lenient` partially recovered (10.2%→15.3%, though still short of the broken run's
  18.42% — some of that original number likely reflected the model confabulating "correct-
  looking" wrong answers rather than being genuinely well-calibrated, so it isn't a clean
  like-for-like comparison; see the confabulation examples earlier in this doc).
- The DPO pairwise gap is now the **largest observed across every run in this project**: C
  (SFT+DPO) wins 48/105 (45.7%) vs E (SFT only) 22/105 (21.0%) — a 24.7pp gap, well above the
  original v1_scale run's 19.0pp and the over-corrected run's near-total-ties result (79/105
  ties, vs this run's 35/105). With false-abstention no longer dominating both systems'
  behavior, real quality differences between them are visible again.

**Verdict: the rebalance is a real, working fix** — not a perfect one (32.1% false-abstention
is still a real cost, and a genuinely careful tuning pass would likely find an even better
ratio/diversity setting), but a substantial, honestly-measured improvement over both the
original broken state and the over-corrected intermediate state. Further tuning (e.g. trying
intermediate ratios between 5%/6% and 10%/15%, or per-loss-weighting rather than ratio
adjustment) is a reasonable next step but not pursued further in this pass — the core ask
(fix the over-abstention tradeoff) has a real, measured, positive result.

## Known limitations

- Single seed throughout (same limitation as all prior passes in this project).
- The rebalanced fix improves but does not eliminate the false-abstention cost (32.1%, down
  from 69.2% but still above the original broken run's 9.9%) — a genuinely optimal ratio/
  diversity setting was not searched for; the values used (5%/6%, 4 paraphrases) were a
  reasonable first attempt, not a tuned optimum.
- The headline `pra_lenient`/`uar` table near the top of this doc and its DPO pairwise numbers
  reflect the *original* (bugged) run, not the final rebalanced one — kept for historical
  continuity with the initial writeup; the corrected/final numbers are in this section.
- C-vs-E pairwise still uses a 105-probe subsample (same size as v0, for comparability), not
  the full 688-probe set — a full-scale pairwise run would tighten the confidence further but
  wasn't run here to keep evaluation cost proportionate.
- PCS was not yet implemented when this pass ran (2026-08-14) — it now exists
  (`src/onebee/evaluation/metrics/persona_consistency.py`, added 2026-08-15) but hasn't been
  applied retroactively to this pass's checkpoints. See `docs/distillation_results.md` for its
  first real application.
