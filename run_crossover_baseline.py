# H16/H17 (RQ12) crossover experiment: does the small model (~2B) + full memory/retrieval
# scaffold beat a much larger (7-8B class) UNAUGMENTED model -- no memory, no retrieval, no
# fine-tuning, just the raw teacher checkpoint answering from a bare system prompt -- on
# personalized-memory tasks (H16, expect the small+scaffold system to win) vs multi-step
# reasoning (H17, expect the larger raw model to still win). Uses gemma-4-E4B-it (8B) as the
# large-model baseline since it's already verified in this project (the H23 distillation
# teacher) -- same tokenizer family as the small model, no new model to source or validate.
#
# NOT YET RUN -- this is the ready-to-fire script; running it needs a GPU (8B model) and judge
# API access. Compare its System-F (raw 8B, no memory) results against the small model's best
# scaffolded result (System E-distill / H23, see docs/distillation_results.md) once run.
