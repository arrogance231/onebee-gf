Persona-contrastive preference pairs: chosen = real teacher (gpt-5.6-luna) response using
injected memory context (same pipeline as data/sft/v0), rejected = a generic persona-breaking
AI-assistant disclaimer, matching the exact failure mode observed in Day 3's raw-model
evaluation ("I am a large language model, trained by Google."). Built from the same 4 SFT
personas as data/sft/v0/ (disjoint from the PMB-v0 eval set).

- Total pairs: {len(pairs)} ({len(train)} train / {len(val)} val)
- Only turns where memory was actually retrieved are included (a meaningful preference signal
  requires there to be a "right" character-consistent answer to prefer).
- rejected responses are a fixed pool of 5 hand-written disclaimer sentences, not
  teacher-generated — a deliberate, cheap way to encode "always prefer being in-character over
  a generic disclaimer" as the DPO signal, not a nuanced quality preference.
- Not human-reviewed.
