# onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch

> DPO on the v0 preference dataset run for 4 epochs — a deliberate overfitting experiment, not a recommended checkpoint.

[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-small--mind--companion-blue)](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion)

## Model Overview

A deliberate overfitting experiment: the same 200-pair v0 preference dataset as `dpo-v0`, but trained for 4 epochs instead of 1, to study how DPO degrades when over-trained on a small preference set. Published for reproducibility of that specific experiment, not as a general-purpose checkpoint.

## Model Details

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| Model | `onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch` |
| Parameters | ~2B effective (base) + LoRA rank 16 adapter |
| Architecture | Gemma4 (multimodal, text + vision) |
| Base Model | [`google/gemma-4-E2B-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E2B-it) |
| Language | English |
| Context Length | 131,072 tokens (inherited from base model) |
| Training Method | LoRA DPO, 4 epochs (vs. 1 epoch for dpo-v0), same 200-pair v0 dataset |
| License | Apache-2.0 (inherited from base model) |

## Intended Use

### Intended Use

Studying DPO overfitting behavior on small preference datasets. Not recommended for deployment or as a training base.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Not evaluated or intended for: safety-critical decisions, medical/legal/financial advice, or any
deployment where a wrong or overconfident answer causes real harm. This is a research artifact
from an open-source project studying post-training and memory architecture on small models — see
[the project README](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion) for the full research framing before using it in any
production context.

## Capabilities

- Same base capabilities as dpo-v0, with observed overfitting artifacts from extended training

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-4epoch")

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a warm AI companion who remembers this user."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What conference did I say I was attending?"},
]
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
print(processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Evaluation

Scored against **PMB** (Personalized Memory Benchmark), 688 adversarial probes across 8
categories, with an LLM judge under dual-order (position-bias-controlled) scoring plus a
rule-based abstention detector.

See `docs/dpo_results.md` for the overfitting-experiment comparison against dpo-v0.

Full methodology, all numbers, and honest limitations:
[`docs/dpo_results.md`](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion/blob/main/docs/dpo_results.md).

## Limitations

Explicitly overfit by design — do not use this checkpoint as a general-purpose companion model.

This project reports negative/inconclusive results as honestly as positive ones — read the
linked docs before assuming any number here is a clean win.
