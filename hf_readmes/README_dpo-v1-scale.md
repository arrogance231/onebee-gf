# onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale

> Proper-scale LoRA DPO checkpoint on top of sft-v1 (2049 preference pairs) — pre-distillation, strongest preference-optimization signal in this project.

[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-small--mind--companion-blue)](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion)

## Model Overview

Proper-scale DPO checkpoint on top of `sft-v1` — 2049 preference pairs (~10x `dpo-v0`'s scale), 1 epoch. Strongest and cleanest preference-optimization signal observed across every run in this project (24.7pp pairwise win-rate gap). **Superseded by `onebee-gf-distill-v1`** (adds on-policy distillation on top of this checkpoint) as the current best overall, but this remains the pre-distillation baseline used in that comparison, and the checkpoint the published GGUF quantizations are built from.

## Model Details

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| Model | `onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale` |
| Parameters | ~2B effective (base) + LoRA rank 16 adapter |
| Architecture | Gemma4 (multimodal, text + vision) |
| Base Model | [`google/gemma-4-E2B-it`](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-E2B-it) |
| Language | English |
| Context Length | 131,072 tokens (inherited from base model) |
| Training Method | LoRA DPO, 1 epoch, 2049 preference pairs, chained off sft-v1 |
| License | Apache-2.0 (inherited from base model) |

## Intended Use

### Intended Use

As a base for distillation or quantization; as a strong standalone companion checkpoint if distillation-specific behavior is not desired.

### Out-of-Scope Use

Not evaluated or intended for: safety-critical decisions, medical/legal/financial advice, or any
deployment where a wrong or overconfident answer causes real harm. This is a research artifact
from an open-source project studying post-training and memory architecture on small models — see
[the project README](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion) for the full research framing before using it in any
production context.

## Capabilities

- Companion-persona conversational responses with strong preference alignment
- UAR (unanswerable-question calibration): 70.0%

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoProcessor

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale")

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a warm AI companion who remembers this user."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What conference did I say I was attending?"},
]
inputs = processor.apply_chat_template(messages, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt")
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
print(processor.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Evaluation

Scored against **PMB** (Personalized Memory Benchmark), 688 adversarial probes across 8
categories, with an LLM judge under dual-order (position-bias-controlled) scoring plus a
rule-based abstention detector.

| System | pairwise win-rate | UAR |
|---|---|---|
| dpo-v1-scale | 45.7% vs 21.0% (24.7pp gap) | 70.0% |

Full methodology, all numbers, and honest limitations:
[`docs/proper_scale_results.md`](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion/blob/main/docs/proper_scale_results.md).

## Limitations

Single seed/run at this data scale. See `onebee-gf-distill-v1` for the further-improved current-best checkpoint.

This project reports negative/inconclusive results as honestly as positive ones — read the
linked docs before assuming any number here is a clean win.
