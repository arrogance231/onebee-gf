# onebee-gf-distill-v1-gguf

> GGUF quantizations (12 levels, F16 through Q2_K, plus vision projector) of the current-best post-distillation companion checkpoint, for `llama.cpp`-based on-device inference.

[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-small--mind--companion-blue)](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion)

## Model Overview

GGUF conversion and quantization of
[`onebee-gf-distill-v1`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-distill-v1) — the current
best checkpoint from **small-mind-companion** (LoRA SFT → DPO → on-policy distillation from an
8B-class teacher, on top of `gemma-4-E2B-it`) — for `llama.cpp`-based local/on-device inference.

- **What it is**: the same weights as `onebee-gf-distill-v1`, converted to GGUF.
- **What it does**: runs the current-best companion checkpoint on-device without a Python/
  `transformers` runtime.
- **What makes it different from [`onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale-gguf`](https://huggingface.co/arrochi112/onebee-gf-dpo-v1-scale-gguf)**:
  quantized from the *post-distillation* checkpoint, not the pre-distillation one — this is the
  checkpoint the project's headline H23 results are actually about.
- **Real generation testing found Q2_K broken for this checkpoint** — garbled special-token
  output and a non-terminating repetition loop, not usable. Q3_K_S and above verified coherent
  and in-character. See [Limitations](#limitations).
- **Base model**: `google/gemma-4-E2B-it`.

## Intended Use

### Intended Use

Local/on-device inference via `llama.cpp` where a `transformers`/Python runtime isn't
available or desired. **Use Q3_K_S or above** — Q2_K was found broken on real generation
testing for this checkpoint (see Limitations).

### Out-of-Scope Use

Not evaluated or intended for: safety-critical decisions, medical/legal/financial advice, or any
deployment where a wrong or overconfident answer causes real harm. This is a research artifact
from an open-source project studying post-training and memory architecture on small models — see
[the project README](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion) for the full research
framing before using it in any production context.

## Capabilities

- Text and vision (image) input
- 12 quant levels (F16 → Q2_K), though **Q2_K is not usable — see Limitations**
- Verified in-character companion-style generation at Q3_K_S, Q3_K_M, Q4_K_S, Q4_K_M

| `distill-v1-Q3_K_M.gguf` | Q3_K_M | 3.19 GB | Verified coherent, in-character — **recommended smallest safe level** |
| `distill-v1-Q3_K_S.gguf` | Q3_K_S | 3.10 GB | Verified coherent, in-character |
| `distill-v1-Q2_K.gguf` | Q2_K | 2.98 GB | **Broken — do not use, see Limitations** |
| `mmproj-distill-v1-f16.gguf` | F16 | 0.99 GB | Vision projector — needed for image input, use with any of the above |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# build llama.cpp, or install a prebuilt release: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
```

### Usage

Text:
```bash
llama-cli -m distill-v1-Q4_K_M.gguf -sys "You are a warm AI companion in an ongoing relationship with the user." -p "Hello!" -st
```

Vision (needs `--jinja`):
```bash
llama-mtmd-cli -m distill-v1-Q4_K_M.gguf \
  --mmproj mmproj-distill-v1-f16.gguf \
  --image your_image.png -p "What is in this image?" --jinja
```

## Evaluation

Real generation quality checks (companion system prompt, "What is your favorite color?"):

| Quant | Result |
|---|---|
| Q4_K_S | Coherent, in-character: *"soft white... calm and open, without being cold or stark"* |
| Q3_K_M | Coherent, in-character: *"amber—the soft, buttery glow right before sunset"* |
| Q3_K_S | Coherent, in-character: *"emerald... like the color of moss after a spring rain"* |
| Q2_K | Broken: garbled special tokens followed by a non-terminating repetition loop |

Full methodology: [`docs/quantization_results.md`](https://github.com/arrogance231/small-mind-companion/blob/main/docs/quantization_results.md).

## Limitations

- **Q2_K is broken for this checkpoint** — confirmed via real generation testing, not
  file-size/load checks. Do not use it. Whether this is specific to the distillation stage
  making the model more quantization-sensitive, or Q2_K was never safe for this model family at
  all (untested previously), is not yet determined — see the full writeup.
- No accuracy/quality regression measured against the project's own PMB eval harness at each
  quant level — verified "coherent and on-topic" via real generation tests, not "measurably as
  accurate as F16."
- No importance-matrix (imatrix) calibration used for these quants.
- This is a research checkpoint from an active, in-progress open-source project.
